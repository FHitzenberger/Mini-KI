# Project Readme for TensorFlow-based Image Classification Project

## Project Name: Image Classification with TensorFlow

### Overview:
This repository contains the source code for an image classification project using the TensorFlow library. The model is trained to distinguish between two classes (in this case, "+" and "-").

```

### 2. Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
- Python (recommended: version 3.6 or higher)
- TensorFlow (installed via `pip install tensorflow`)
- Keras (installed via `pip install keras`)
- scipy (installed via `pip install scipy`)

### 3. Installation <a name="installation"></a>
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 4. Data Preparation <a name="data-preparation"></a>
- Place training images in the `train` directory and test images in the `test` directory. Organize images into subfolders according to their classes.

### 5. Model Training <a name="model-training"></a>
- Run the script `model_training.py` to train the model: `python model_training.py`
- The trained model will be saved and can be used for predictions.

### 6. Prediction <a name="prediction"></a>
- Use the script `make_prediction.py` to make predictions on new data: `python make_prediction.py`

### 7. Customization and Improvements <a name="customization-and-improvements"></a>
- Experiment with model architectures in `model_training.py` for potential improvements.
- Adjust hyperparameters and add more data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.

### 8. License <a name="license"></a>
